## Counterfactual

#### Model to use
Instead of using the LSTM baseline model directly, we have to implementation some modifications to run on **DiCE**.

![Model-Image](https://github.com/ChihchengHsieh/LINDA-BN-Eventlog-TF/blob/master/imgs/DiCEBinaryOutputModelImg.png?raw=true)

#### Example:

1. Assume we have input trace like this.
```python
['<SOS>', 'A_SUBMITTED_COMPLETE', 'A_PARTLYSUBMITTED_COMPLETE',
'A_PREACCEPTED_COMPLETE', 'A_ACCEPTED_COMPLETE',
'O_SELECTED_COMPLETE', 'A_FINALIZED_COMPLETE', 'O_CREATED_COMPLETE',
'O_SENT_COMPLETE','W_Completeren aanvraag_COMPLETE',
'W_Nabellen offertes_COMPLETE']
```

2. If we throw it into the LSTM baseline model, we can get the result (Probability distribution of next activity):

![output_distribution](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37566901/121657112-74bf1980-cae3-11eb-85e6-3c0cf959b0db.png)

from above we can know the model think `"W_Nabellen offertes_COMPLETE"` has highest probability (0.640346) to be next activity.

3. Then, we feed the same trace to DiCE for generating couterfactuals. 

DiCE return a counterfactual like this:

Or the full counterfataul trace like this:

```python
['A_ACCEPTED_COMPLETE', 'A_PARTLYSUBMITTED_COMPLETE', 'A_PREACCEPTED_COMPLETE',
'A_ACCEPTED_COMPLETE', 'O_SELECTED_COMPLETE', 'A_FINALIZED_COMPLETE', 'O_CREATED_COMPLETE',
'O_SENT_COMPLETE', 'W_Completeren aanvraag_COMPLETE', 'O_DECLINED_COMPLETE']
```

However,from above example, we can indentify some issues when using event log with DiCE.

#### Issues

- The counterfactual doesn't follow the constraints from BPI2012. Everycase should start with `A_SUBMITTED_COMPLETE`. However, the counterfactaul replace it with `A_ACCEPTED_COMPLETE`, which occurs two times in the trace.

- The fail trace is hard to find counterfactual. 
The average length for successful cases and failed cases are `27.94` and `10.53`, respectively. When we're trying to take a fail case with `length = 10` to find a successful case counterfactual, it will be hard since the LSTM will indetify most of the short trace tend to end up with declined and our approach can't vary the length of trace.
